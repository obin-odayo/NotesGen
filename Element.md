# Elements

A single variable inside an [[array]].

> `int A[8] = {1, 2, 3}`
> 1, 2, and 3 are elements of `A`.
> 4 is not an element of `A` because it is not defined in the array.
> The size of an array is the product of the dimension, number of elements, and the type of the elements, see [[Memory#Size of Data Types]].

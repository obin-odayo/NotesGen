# Array Declaration

[Supplementary Source Code](src/array_declaration.c)

[[Array]]s are declared with the data type of its elements (see [[Homogenous]]), the name of the array, and its size.

```dataType arrayName[arraySize = int]```
> When the array is declared but not defined, it will be filled with [[Garbage Values]].

Arrays can also be declared and defined simultanously.

**Example**
```int arrayA[10], arrayB[5]```
> Both arrays have the homogenous data type `int`.

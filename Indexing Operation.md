Also known as subscript operation. Is used to accessing the value stored in an array.

> `int A[] = {10, 23, 11, 63, -55, 99, -20, 88};`
> > To index or access an element in the array `A`. Use the indexing operation denoted by the square brackets `[]`.   
> > Array indexing is limited to integers, so decimal indexes return a **syntax error**.   
> > When an array index is out of bounds this is an [[illegal memory access]].

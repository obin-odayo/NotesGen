# Illegal Memory Access

An illegal memory acces is when the memory illegally accessed; when the program tries to access a memory location that **does not exist** or is inaccessible.

Illegal indexing is a **logical error**.

> `int A[8] = {10, 23, 11, 63, -55, 99, -20, 88};`  
> `A[-1]` is an illegal index because index -1 in not within the range of A.
